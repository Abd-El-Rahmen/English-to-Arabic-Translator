# English to Arabic Translation from Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates building a translation model from scratch to convert English text to Arabic. The notebook is designed to guide users through the process of preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

While the journey was educational and rewarding, I wasnâ€™t able to achieve high accuracy in the results. ðŸ˜…

## Features
- **Language Translation**: Translates text from English to Arabic.
- **Custom Model**: Built from scratch to provide an understanding of core concepts in machine translation (using transfomer architecture).
- **Detailed Steps**: Includes data preprocessing, tokenization, model architecture, and evaluation.

## Contents
- `English_to_arabic_from_scratch.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abd-El-Rahmen/English-to-Arabic-Translator.git
   cd English-to-Arabic-Translator
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook English_to_arabic_from_scratch.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess your dataset.
   - Train the translation model.
   - Evaluate the model on test data.

## Dataset
The notebook requires a parallel English-Arabic text dataset. You can either:
- Provide your own dataset in a compatible format.
- Use the dataset that i used but   you have to Set up Kaggle API key .

Make sure to specify the dataset path in the notebook.

## Output
- Translated Arabic text for given English inputs.
- Training and validation metrics.
